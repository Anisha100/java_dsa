HashSet is an implementation of Set Interface which does not allow duplicate value. The main thing is, objects that are stored in HashSet must
override equals() for check for equality, and hashCode() methods for no duplicate value are stored in our set. HashMap is an implementation of Map
Interface, which maps a key to value. Duplicate keys are not allowed in a Map. Basically, Map Interface has two implementation classes HashMap and 
TreeMap the main difference is TreeMap maintains an order of the objects but HashMap will not.HashMap allows null values and null keys. Both HashSet 
and HashMap are not synchronized.
